Hello , My name is Shivam Varma and
This are the projects which are developed by me under the internship provided by oasis infobyte as java developer.

It is the project which provides all functionalities of ATM machine and it is written in JAVA.

2- Number guessing game (Num_guess.java)
It is the number guessing game where users can play by guessing a number , if the guessed number matches with actual number , user wins or if it is not user will lose.
